## Concept
I believe that language is the universal key for knowledge. 
We often hear that "the world is a small village", which is more true than ever.
Jangalma is here to bridging the gap between people and a world full of opportunity. 

This is the front-office, available as a mobile application on ANDROID and IOS

## Overview
The platform is composed of a Front-Office (Mobile App) and a Back-Office (Web App)

There are 3 types of users:
- Teachers, can access both Front-Office (whole features) and Back-Office (with limited features)
- Students, get only access to the Front-Office (limited features)
- Super Admin, can access both Front-Office (with full access) and Back-Office (with full access)
